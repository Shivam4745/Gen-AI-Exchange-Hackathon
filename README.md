# Gen-AI-Exchange-Hackathon


AI Career Advisor
This is a single-file web application that acts as an AI-powered career advisor for students. It's built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Real-time Chat: The application provides a seamless chat interface where users can ask questions about their career paths, skills, and job market trends.

AI-Powered Advice: It uses the Gemini API to provide personalized and data-driven career guidance, including skill-to-job mapping, skill gap analysis, and interview preparation tips.

Persistent Storage: All chat conversations are saved to a public Firestore database, ensuring a real-time, multi-user experience. This means you can share the app with others and see the conversation evolve live.

Responsive Design: The interface is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing and interaction experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

How to Use
View the Preview: Since this is a single HTML file, you can directly open it in a web browser to run the application.

Start Chatting: The app will automatically sign you in anonymously. Your unique user ID will be displayed in the header.

Ask Away: Begin typing your questions in the input field. The AI will provide tailored advice based on your queries and the conversation history.

Note: This application is for demonstration purposes. The Firestore database is public, so any data you enter will be visible to others using the same app instance.
